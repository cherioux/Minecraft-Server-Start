# Minecraft Server Start
This program helps you run a minecraft server easier.
#### Start of File
### Server-Start.exe Version 1.4  ![GitHub version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.4.02-brightgreen.svg)
  There are several options to help the user start a minecraft server, but only three options are displayed.
  
		Enter "firstRun" (without quotes) when you first download the program and place it in the minecraft server's directory.
			this will set up the program's working environment. Restart the program after running this command.
			
		Enter "1" to start the Minecraft server normally. Use this most of the time.
		
		Enter "3" to check the ip without adding it to a text file.
		
		Enter "newwin" (without quotes) to start a new instance of Server-Start.exe. Note this does not allow for two instances of the same Minecraft server to be run a the same time.
		
		Enter "VerHist" (without quotes) to go to the program's version history
		
		Enter "ipoutput" (without quotes, all lowercase) to have the program place the IPv4 information into a text(txt) file.
		
		Enter "9" (without quotes) to start the Minecraft Server with 1gb of ram (default is 2gb)
		
		Enter "CLS" (without quotes) to clear the screen.
		
	There are more, but you will have to find those ;)
	
	Don't rename the program. It should be named "Server-Start.exe" and nothing else. If its not, some features will not work.
	
This is the basics of the program.
